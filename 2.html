  <h2>Processing</h2>

  <h3>WASHED/WET PROCESSED</h3>
  <p>Most of the coffee we sell is “washed,” or wet-processed. For this process, the freshly-harvested coffee cherries are de-pulped, which removes the skin and most of the fruit around the bean. The coffee then is placed in tanks where it is allowed to naturally ferment for 18-24 hours. This fermentation begins to break down the mucilage, which is a sugary, slimy substance that surrounds the bean.</p>
  <p>Once the grower determines that the coffee has had enough fermentation, the coffee is washed with fresh water, stopping the fermentation process. Then the coffee is dried on raised beds or patios before resting for 60-90 days in warehouses and being shipped to us.</p>
  <h3>NATURAL/DRY-PROCESSED</h3>
  <p>The second most common process that we carry is natural or dry-processed. Ripe cherries are laid out on a patio or on raised beds, fruit intact, and the coffee is allowed to dry slowly. Once dry, the fruit is stripped away from the bean in a depulping machine. Coffees that are dry-processed tend to be fruitier and can be very intense and berry-like.</p>
  <p>Both PT’s and Bird Rock have offered a coffee from Ethiopia, Gedeo, which is a good example of a classic, naturally-processed coffee. This particular coffee works wonderfully as espresso, evidenced by Bird Rock’s roast winning a Gold Medal at the 2017 Golden Bean Awards.</p>
  <p>There are differences in the cup between PT’s version and Bird Rock’s, so this is a nice opportunity to experience the effects that roasting on different machines can have on the same bean. Bird Rock uses a Loring Roaster while PT’s uses both a vintage Gothot roaster and newer Dietrich IRs. These roasters apply heat differently to the green coffee, so even though the final roast degree of the bean is the same on each roaster, the acidity, body, and complexity are altered based on how the coffee roasts.</p>
  <p>One variation on the Natural Process is called the Wine Process. With a Wine-Processed coffee, instead of harvesting the cherries at the peak of harvest, the cherries are allowed to over-ripen on the shrub, giving them a higher concentration of sugar and a slightly fermented flavor.</p>
  <h3>HONEY PROCESS</h3>
  <p>Honeyed coffee has grown in popularity over the last few years, especially in countries like Costa Rica and El Salvador. For Honeyed coffee, the harvested cherries are de-pulped, then the coffee is immediately placed on beds for slow drying—bits of pulp/fruit included. Depending on how much pulp is left on the coffee, Honeyed coffee can be classified as Yellow, Red, or Black. Coffee processed in this way tends to be fruit-forward like a natural and a little creamier in mouthfeel than a washed coffee.</p>
